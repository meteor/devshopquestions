<h3>Welcome to Devshop Questions!</h3>

<p>This app helps people give and receive help in person at <a href="http://devshop.meteor.com">Meteor Devshop</a>, our monthly community coworking event. If you have a Meteor-related question at Devshop, post it along with your name and location. If you see a question you might be able to help with, please go find the asker in person and see what you can do! You will probably both learn a lot. We also have an awesome group of volunteers who take shifts keeping an eye on questions.</p>

<p>A great way to spend Devshop is to work on a Meteor project, and post whenever you have a question or problem. If you're new to Meteor, take a look at our "<a href="http://www.meteor.com/learn-meteor">Learn Meteor</a>" page for some excellent community learning resources.</p>

    <h3>Tips:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Questions only, please! If you would like to make an announcement to your fellow Devshop-goers, please tweet the announcement and tag it <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23devshop&f=realtime">#Devshop</a>.</p></li>
      <li><p>Please mark your question as "answered" if it has been addressed, or delete it if you want to take it back. Questions should be "actionable," i.e. there should be a definable endpoint for when the question has been answered.</p></li>
      <li><p>If your question is a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic">Stack Overflow-type question</a>, consider posting the question there (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/meteor">tagged meteor</a>), then linking to it in your Devshop Questions post. This allows the rest of the Meteor community to benefit from your question, and people outside of Devshop may be able to help you too. Don't forget to share the answer on SO if you are helped at Devshop. (Read: "<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">How do I ask a good question?</a>") </p></li>
      <li><p>Not all questions need to be Stack Overflow-type questions! Because answerers help you in person, it's fine to ask a question like "Can someone explain (X concept) to me? I keep reading about it, but still don't understand." Or "Can someone come click through my app for 5 minutes? I want to see if the UI is intuitive."</p></li>
      <li><p>You don't need to describe your question in exhaustive detail, but you should provide enough context for someone to predict whether they can help you. Meteorites of all levels attend Devshop and answer questions. "Help with a bug?" is not a good question.</p></li>
      <li><p>If you have feedback about the DevshopQuestions app, please e-mail <a href="mailto:community@meteor.com">community@meteor.com</a>. Enjoy!</p></li>
